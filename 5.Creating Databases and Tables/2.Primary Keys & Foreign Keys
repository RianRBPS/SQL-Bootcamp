[PK] Primary Key

A primary key is a column or a group of columns used to identify a row uniquely in a table

For example, in our dvdrental database we saw customers had a unique, non-null customer_id coumn as their primary key

Primary keys are also important since they allow us to easily discern what columns should be used for joining tables together

In Constraints you can see if a key is foreign
